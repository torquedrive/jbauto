            <p>J&B Automotive Restoration's philosophy is that the client should be part of the build to ensure that everyone understands the objective of the project. With this as the foundation, the client can enjoy the process of restoring their classic or custom car, and be completely satisfied with the end result.
            </p>
            <p>J&B Automotive Restoration sits down with every customer to discuss what their expectations are for their project. We listen to our customers and work with them to make all final decisions.&nbsp; We discuss whether you are looking for a driver car or a show car. We talk about your budget and look at a time line based on money flow and urgency of project completion. During the project if any issues arise we immediately stop all work to discuss a solution in order to minimize surprises and additional costs.&nbsp; We take pictures throughout the project to document the process of the project. We email you pictures during the entire project and provide a disc with all the pictures at the end. We do have an open door policy which means our clients are welcome to stop in at any time to see how their project is coming along.&nbsp; We pride ourselves in working one on one with every client to make sure that their expectations are being met on their classic, custom or vintage car.</p>

            <p>We may be able to perform an inspection of your project and write an estimate based on what we can see. An estimate is just that, an estimate of what it may cost to complete your project. this estimate can be used as a reference only and may not reflect the actual costs.</p>

            <p>Then when your project begins depending on the size of the project we ask for 30% to 50% draw to cover parts and materials. Once the draw is depleted the client receives an itemized bill stating labor hours, work performed and parts/material costs. At this time an additional draw is obtained to continue working on the project. If your project stalls at anytime during the process due to non-payment storage fees will be applied.</p>
