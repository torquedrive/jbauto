		<h2>Bodywork</h2>

		<p>Body work is the foundation for a stunning paint job. We start with a freshly media blasted body, then we etch prime with two coats of epoxy for adhesion. We then put the whole car together to begin aligning and tweaking to ensure the body lines are straight. At times some welding may be required in order to fix gap issues that the vehicle may have aquired this is due to factory alignment when the car came off the production line. Our goal is to remove all waves, dents and creases out of the body of the vehicle with a minimal amount of body filler. Body filler is necessary in classic cars in order to get the body straight; it does not happen on itâ€™s own. After all the body work is done the vehicle is then taken apart and then primed with high build primer.</p>
